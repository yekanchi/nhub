// (The following example requires the NORTHWIND database to run. You can
//  download the Northwind database here:
//  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/downloading-sample-databases
//
//  Follow the installation instructions at that URL then set your connection in this query window to
//  your Northwind database.)
// 
// Suppose you want to project a nested grouping, for example, producing
// a hierarchical output of countries, cities and post codes as follows:
//
//   Brazil
//      Campinas
//         04876-786
//      Resende
//         08737-363
//      Rio de Janeiro
//         02389-673
//         02389-890
//         05454-876
//
// We'll assume the country, city and post code information is all in one table called Orders 
// (as is it in the NORTHWIND sample database).
//
// To write this query, you need to nest one "group by" within the projection of another:

var query =
	from o in Orders
	group o by o.ShipCountry into countryGroups
	select new
	{
		Country = countryGroups.Key,
		Cities =
			from cg in countryGroups
			group cg.ShipPostalCode by cg.ShipCity into cityGroups
			select new
			{
				City = cityGroups.Key,
				PostCodes = cityGroups.Distinct()
			}
};

query.Dump();

// In this case, at the bottom level we are interested only in a simple list of postal codes (not in
// any further information about those orders) so we can use a simple Distinct to get the desired list.
//
// Here's how to programmatically enumerate the result:

foreach (var countryGroup in query)
{
	Console.WriteLine (countryGroup.Country);
	foreach (var cityGroup in countryGroup.Cities)
	{
		Console.WriteLine ("   " + cityGroup.City);
		foreach (string postCode in cityGroup.PostCodes)
			Console.WriteLine ("      " + postCode);
	}
}
